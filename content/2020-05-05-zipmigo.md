Please welcome to the world my new ðŸ‘¶, [zipmigo](https://github.com/kaszklar/zipmigo)! Zipmigo is a python package that aims to help analysts download and unarchive zipfiles remotely.

I was recently given the opportunity to develop some notebooks for teaching GIS and spatial econometrics in python for a professor of mine. Having taken the course previously, I had a good idea of the level of exposure students had to programming and the shell. I also began using the same code over and over again to download shape file archives, which is a sure sign you should start modularizing. With all of that in mind, I began working on a script to download and unzip those archives so that students working in the cloud wouldn't have to muddle around trying to figure out why a simple http request doesn't work, or wonder where their file got unzipped to.

Recrusive directory structure is one of my biggest pet peeves, so the true ðŸŒŸ of this little library is that it checks the top level of the archive and will unzip to the current directory or an appropriately named subdirectory.   

You can get it via `pip install zipmigo`, and check out some example functionality in the [read me](https://github.com/kaszklar/zipmigo).
