### hi, I'm katie

I'm a **data engineer** who is obsessed with building infrastructure and datasets that stakeholders can have confidence in. You could say my ~data journey~ began at age 13, when I taught myself SQL because I thought databases were *cool*... too bad I had nothing to put in there besides my favorite [neopets](https://www.neopets.com). I love working with messy, wonky shaped data, especially for geospatial and network analyses. When I'm not coding, you can find me at the cliff, at the reef, or catching the ðŸŒ† on my bike.
